Social Cipher (SC) is an open-source project for social networks formed as a client application for Android devices. It's main feature is a Sessional Ciphering: nobody is capable to decipher your transferred data out of the session.

Bullet Points:
- VK is the only Social Network to work with for now;
- Diffie-Hellman is used for session setting stuff;
- AES-256/CTR/NoPadding is the only ciphering configuration for now;
- Cache cleaning is up to you (you can accomplish it by clicking the "refreshing" button on your chats' screen);
- It hasn't been tested properly yet.

System Requirements:
- Android API Level 26+.

You are welcome to give it a shot and dive into more specific details. It would be nice to receive some feedback as well!

The whole stuff has been developed by Semyon Dzukaev.
